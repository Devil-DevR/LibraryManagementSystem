## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 📌 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)

---

### 🚀 Clone and Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/book-management-system.git
cd book-management-system
```

### 📦 Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install root dependencies (for dev tools)
npm install

# Install backend
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

---

### 🔐 Setup Environment Variables

#### backend/.env

```
PORT=4000
MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-uri
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

#### frontend/.env

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
```

---

### ▶️ Start Development Server

At project root, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

> This uses `concurrently` to start both backend (`localhost:4000`) and frontend (`localhost:3000`).
